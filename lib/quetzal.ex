  Quetzal - Analytical web apps, fast, easy and real-time using Elixir. No Javascript required.

  Quetzal provides easy and fast tools to make analytical web apps with real-time updates.

  Quetzal provides the next features:

  * Allows create componets from Elixir code and render into views such as: graphs (plotlyjs),
    inputs and more.

  * It uses a single function to allow update the components via server so instead of
    pulling data it is pushing data whenever you want.

  * It tracks events from components and receives in the live view to
    update live view components.

  ## Using components

  First, define a module and use `Quetzal.LiveView`, you don't need `mount/2` or `render/1`,
  when using the Quetzal Live View all is done:

      defmodule AppWeb.PieLive do
        use Quetzal.LiveView
      end

  With this minimal configuration Quetzal is able to render any component into the view, let's
  generate a pie graph to render:

      defmodule AppWeb.PieLive do
        use Quetzal.LiveView

        @impl Quetzal.LiveView
        def components(_session) do
          {"MyApp", [{Quetzal.Graph, [id: "mypie"], [type: "pie", labels: ["Red", "Blue"], values: [10, 20]]}]}
        end
      end

  The callback returns a new graph component and put into the view the necessary items
  to work with it.

  ## Live updates

  Now, we are going to the real-time cases, let's say we want update our pie graph when an
  event occurs in the server, so let's define a trigger to make it:

      defmodule AppWeb.PieLive do
        use Quetzal.LiveView

        @impl Quetzal.LiveView
        def components(_session) do
          {"MyApp", [{Quetzal.Graph, [id: "mypie"], [type: "pie", labels: ["Red", "Blue"], values: [10, 20]]}]}
        end

        def trigger_update() do
          :timer.sleep(5000)
          newvalues = for _n <- 1..3, do: :rand.uniform(100)
          components = [mypie: [labels: ["Black", "White", "Gray"], values: newvalues]]
          update_components("MyApp", components)
          trigger_update()
        end
      end

  Let's explain the code, first to all, the `trigger_update/0` can be called from iex:

      iex(1)> AppWeb.PieLive.trigger_update

  Then every 5 ms a random numbers will be generated and put into values of the pie graph, and the
  pie graph will be updated, nice eh?.

  To achieve this, Quetzal uses the `update_components/2` function to render the new content, also
  you need configure the javascript hooks, only pass the hooks into the live socket connection:

      ...
      import Quetzal from "quetzal_hooks"
      let quetzal = new Quetzal();
      ...
      let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {hooks: quetzal.Hooks})  

  With this minimal configuration, we able to make a real-time app that updates the graph from the
  live view server.

  ## Live updates with callbacks

  Quetzal supports callbacks to deliver when a data has changed in a form, and then performs some update
  in the components, let's inspect the next code:

      defmodule AppWeb.LiveView do
        use Quetzal.LiveView,
          handler: __MODULE__,
          callbacks: [:update_output_div]

        @impl Quetzal.LiveView
        def components() do
          [{Quetzal.Form, [id: "myform", name: "myform",
             children: [{Quetzal.InputText, [id: "mytext", value: "", type: "text", name: "mytext"]}]
           ]},
          {Quetzal.Div, [id: "mydiv", style: "", children: ""]}]
        end

        def update_output_div("myform", "mytext", [value]) do
          [mydiv: [children: "You've entered \#\{value\} value in the first input"]]
        end
      end

  First define the handler and the callbacks, the handler is a module that will process the events, and the
  callbacks are a list of functions in that module, so when an events occurs then that callbacks will be called.

  In the components we are defining a single form with an input and a div, so when something changes in the
  input the live view server will send an update to the view and render the new children for the div.

  The callbacks receive always 3 arguments, the first is the name of the form containing the components firing the event,
  the second is the match against the component changed and the third is the value of all components in the form.

  ## Notes

  Some notes that you should be take:

  * All setup should be similar to Phoenix Live View setup except for the first step and use `Quetzal.LiveView`.

  * The hooks should be configured into your app.js file.

  * Layouts should include `plotly.js` if you plan to use graphs (can be included from CDN).

  * Ensure that quetzal hooks are included in the package.json:

        ...
        "dependencies": {
          "phoenix": "file:../deps/phoenix",
          "phoenix_html": "file:../deps/phoenix_html",
          "phoenix_live_view": "file:../deps/phoenix_live_view",
          "quetzal_hooks": "file:../deps/quetzal"
        },
        ...

  That's all, we are working to add more examples of components, inputs etc. Enjoy!.
